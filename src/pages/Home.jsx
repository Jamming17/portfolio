                Hello! My name is Jack and welcome to my website! This website has been fully built by me using my full-stack development skills. The code and more infomation about this site is available on my <a href="https://github.com/Jamming17/portfolio" className="underline">GitHub</a>.<br className="mb-6"/>
                I am (almost) a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in many areas of software development. I am currently based in the UK and actively seeking opportunities in south England and in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland.<br className="mb-6"/>
                My degree has given me a solid foundation in many programming languages, full-stack development, cloud development, machine learning and secure development. Details of my skills can be found on the <Link to="/competencoes" className="underline">competencies</Link> page of this site. Additionally, I have completed many projects which can be found in detail on the <Link to="/projects" className="underline">projects</Link> page.<br className="mb-6"/>
                I am particularly passionate about writing clean and efficient code to ease collaboration work and keeping software secure and protected against vulnerabilities. I am eager to bring my adaptability, enthusiasm and problem-solving skills into the tech industry as I begin my career.
